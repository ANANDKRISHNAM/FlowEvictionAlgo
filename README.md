# Project Description: Enhanced ML based Classifier for Network Intrusion Detection

- **Engineered an innovative flow eviction algorithm** for ML models, significantly enhancing detection accuracy in scenarios with large-scale and complex network traffic.
- **Employed feature engineering techniques** to optimize the efficiency of intrusion detection, focusing on a minimal yet effective subset of network features.
- **Developed and fine-tuned a decision tree-based classifier**, achieving high recall and precision in identifying malicious network activities.
- **Demonstrated the model's robustness and scalability**, ensuring its effectiveness in diverse and high-speed network environments.

Why Recall Rate?
Recall rate is important in IDS because it measures the system's ability to accurately detect actual intrusions, minimizing the risk of undetected attacks.
